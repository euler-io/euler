=========================
Euler is a Java API built for processing files using concurrent and scalable infrastructure provided by [Akka](https://akka.io/). The main purpose is to extract data from unstructured content such as texts and images using a customizable and plugable task pipeline.

You can use Euler as a Java API (programatically or via config file) or as a HTTP API. Other languages support are planned in the near future.
